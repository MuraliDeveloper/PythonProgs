Python:
---------
->simple
[ easy to learn, write, read ]
-> Supports both procedural programming + Object oriented programming
-> interpretor [ compilation + execution ] convert from HLL to machine progrmming.
-> no data type specification.
-> ; is optional , [statement termination]


other lang:                                 python
--------------------------------------------------
int x = 90;                                 x = 90
// int is dt                                // 90 is value
//x is variable                             // then datatype of x is int
// 90 is value

x= "hi";                                     x="cost of 90"
                                            // cost of 90 is value
                                            // data type of x is str

a) GUI
B)web apps
C)WEB services
d)Scientific apps
e)Data science or AI or ML or IOT
f)enterprose apps ( bidadata, content , stream, 3D cad , image processing)
