Inheritence:

-> there are two types of classes.
  
  a)Parent class/SUper class/Basse class
  b) sub class/child class/derived class
    
    
Public properties and methods are inherited/available to child classes.

adv: 
reusability




Inheritence Types:
->Single-
-> Multilevel
->Hietrarchial
-?Multiple


synatx:

class Person :
	  name=None
	  age=None
	  id=None

      def m1():
        print("in m1")

      def __m3():
        print("in m3")
  

class Employee(Person):
	pan=None;
	pfNo=None;

    def m2():
      print("in m2")





How many I.V are in Person : 3  (id,name,age)
How manyI.V are in Employee : 5 (id,name,age,pan,pfNo)

  
How many METHODS are in Person : 2  ( m1() and m3() )
How many METHODS are in Employee :  2  ( m1()  & m2() )
  

-> IS-A
Inheritence is relatn between two classes ,
but the parent child and child obj are indendent .
  parent obj and child obj has no relationship.


-> has-a relationship:
relationship is BETween the classes and also BETween the objs.
