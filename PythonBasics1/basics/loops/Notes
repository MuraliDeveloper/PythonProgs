Loops/iterations:
-> execute same code but on different data for multiple runs until condition is satisfied.


python supports :
1.For loop
2.While loop



when should I use FOR loop?
ans) when we know the number of iterations/runs


when should I use WHILE loop?
ans)
when we dont know the number of iterations/runs.

for loop has 3 sections:
1.init
2.condition
3.increment/decerment

=> while loop only condition is mandatory
