What is python role?
->python creates the exception object based on the reason
->Exception obj contains the exception msg + what are the class+method+line nos involved for exeption(stacktrace)
->python stops the application flow..


How to do exception handing:
-------------------------------------------
Introduce 4 blocks:
try  :  write code that has chances for exception
except : write exception handling code ; executed when there is a exception
else : write success  code ; executed when there is no exception
finally : executed every time. optional most of the cases. Required for handling 3rd party resources
