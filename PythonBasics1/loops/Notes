Loops/iterations:
-> execute same code but on different data for multiple runs until condition is satisfied.

python supports :
1.For loop
2.While loop


when should I use FOR loop?
ANS)
when we know the number of iterations/runs



when should I use WHILE loop?
ANS)
when we dont know the number of iterations/runs.

python supports :
1.For loop
2.While loop

for is block where the code  for body should be written with tab space.
for loop has 3 sections:
1.init
2.condition
3.increment/decerment
=> while loop only condition is mandatory

when should i use for loop?
ans) when we know the number of iterations/runs
     when we are looping the collections like list,tuple,dict

when should i use while loop?
ans)
when we dont know the number of iterations/runs.
