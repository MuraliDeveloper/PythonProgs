OOps:
-------
-> modern programing
-> defines common rules, regulations , guidelines for writing the progs.
-> class, object , enapsulation , abstraction , inheritence .

Can a dev create his own data type?
Yes using a class
class is also a data type.

# Class
--------------------------
-> Userdefined datatype
-> Class is used to represent the real time entities/structure/model.
ex: Company, Branch , Dep, sub-dept, Project , Employee ,Address
-> Class doesnt contain any data.
-> class is created before run-time
->class is a logical representation
->class is a template


-> Class is  block for instance variables + instance functions
    a)instance variables to hold data for entity
    b)instance funtion logic would operate on instance variables



z=90  #global variable

def sum(x,y):  #global funtion
     s = x+y    # local variables are x, y , s
     print(s)


class Person:  # Person is a class
  # id , name , age instance variables
	id=None
	name=None
	age=None

  #instance funtion
	def show(self):
		print("hello inside show")
.......

Person is also a datatype

creating the variable/instance for person datatype ===> object


Object:
---------
# variable for the class
# instance for the class
# object is created during run time .
# when obj is created memory is allocated for all instance variables.
# object logical + physical representation

#Syntax for obj creation
p1 = Person()

# p1 internally contains id,name,age


#Set data
p1.id =30000
p1.name ="user1"
p1.age=45

#display data
print(p1.id)
print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)

#Class will decide property names for all objs
#Obj will decide property values..
Access the instance variables and instance functions outside the class using object.

# global varibales ------> outside class   --> memory is allocated 1 time
# local varibales -------> inside function ---> memory is allocated every time when function is called
# instance variables -----> inside class    ---> memory is allocated  every time when obj is crated


# static/class varibles----> inside class ----> memory allocated 1 time  , access with class


1.Requiremnet to capture id,name,age for 10 persons.
solution:
without oops we have to create 30 varibles
without oops we have to create 10 varibles
