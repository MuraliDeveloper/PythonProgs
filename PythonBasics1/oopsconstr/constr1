assignment using constr.:
--------------------------
student has branch , sem,  rollNum
create obj and set data and print the data.



Constructor:
-------------------
When obj is created constr is called automatically.
With constr we can set the data during obj creation.
-> constr has to be written inside the class
 A constr is called only one time for one obj..
 Constr doesnt have any return type.

Constr name is equal to __init__(self):


purpose :
initialize the values for properties/instance variables during obj creation

Adv:
  creat obj + set the data in single line.


Req: create obj + set data

class Person{
id=None
age=None
name=None

}

Old style: (without constr)
----------------
p = Person()
p.id=200
p.name="user1"
p.age=45


New style (with constr):
--------------------
p = Person(200,"user1",45) # create obj + set the data



Changes for class:
-----------------


Req:
Create class for person with id,name , age as instance variables.

Earlier:
-------
class Person:

  id= None
  age= None
  name= None

#id, name , age are insance variables.

P = Person()  #create obj

#set data
p.id=2000
p.name="user1"
p.age=45


__init__.py  -> is a python file name
 __init__ -> is a constructor inside the class
Now:
--------------------
class Person:

   def __init__(self,pId,pName,pAge):
      print("constr is called")
      self.id=pId
      self.name=pName
      self.age=pAge

#__init__ is the constructor
#pId,pName,pAge are the local variables
#self is the defalut param to the constr.
#here id, name, age are the instance variables

p = Person(2000,"user1", 45) # internally calls __init__(self) automatically




earlier:
		1.create obj
		2.set data
Now:
	create obj + set data



 
 //diff between constr and instance funtion.
 1.constr is called one time
 method can b called any no of times

 2.constr name = __init__
 instance funtion  name can be anything

 3.contsr doesnt have any return value
 instance funtion have return type ...

 4.cosntr is called during obj creation
  instance funtion should be called after obj created.


 5.constr is automatic call
  instance funtion is explict call
 
6.constr logic -> only initializing instance variables.
 instance funtion logic -> any logic
