Constructor:
-------------------
When obj is created constr is called automatically.
With constr we can set the data during obj creation.

earlier:
		1.create obj
		2.set data
Now:
	create obj + set data


we need to write constr within the class.
Constr name is equal to __init__(self):
Constr doesnt have any return type.
A constr is called only one time for one obj..




Adv:
  creat obj + set the data in single line.


syntax:

earlier:
	class Person:
  	 id=None
   	 age=None
     name=None

P = Person()  #create obj

#set data
p.id=2000
p.name="user1"
p.age=45



class Person:
    def __init__(self,pId,pName,pAge):
        self.id=pId
        self.name=pName
        self.age=pAge





Now:

p = Person(2000,"user1", 45) # internally calls __init__(self) automatically

Here id, name, age are instance variables.

 
 //diff between constr and insatcne funtion.
 1.constr is called one time
 method can b called any no of times

 2.constr name = __init__
 method  name can be anything

 3.contsr doesnt have any return value
 method have return type ...

 4.cosntr is called during obj creation
  method should be called after obj created.


 5.constr is automatic call
  method is explict call
 
6.constr logic -> only initializing i.v
 method logic -> any logic
