Difference between local varibales , global variables , instance variables:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

x = 90


def process2():
  a =78

class Data:
  y = 100

  def process(self):
    z= 89


Points:
---------------------
class: Data
instance function : process()
global function : process2()
local variables: a and z are local variables
instance variables: y
Global variable: x


local variable:
     - variable created inside the function
     - memory is alocatted every time when the function is called
     - is not associated with object
     - memory is deleted when funtion execution compltes
     - access only inside the funtion or block
     - use for temporary purpose

global variable:
      - variable created outside the class or in global area
      - memory is alocatted 1 time
      - is not associated with object
      - memory is available for long during or till prog terminates
      - acces any where
      - use when we have common data across the project

instance variables:
      - variable created inside the class
      - memory is alocatted every time when object is created.
      - is associated with object
      - memory is deleted when the object is deleted
      - access only using the object
      - use to store the model or entity information ex: one object internally contains multiple data
