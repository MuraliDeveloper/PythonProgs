Difference between local varibales , global variables , instance variables:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

x = 90


def process2(y):
    a = y + 10


class Data:
    b = 100

    def process(self):
        c = 89


"""
Global variable: x
instance variable : b
local variables
   for proces2()   -> a and y
   for process()  -> c
process2() -> global function
process()  -> instance function
"""



local variable:
     - variable created inside the function
     - memory is alocatted every time when the function is called
     - is not associated with object
     - memory is deleted when funtion execution compltes
     - access only inside the funtion or block
     - use for temporary purpose

global variable:
      - variable created outside the class or in global area
      - memory is alocatted 1 time
      - is not associated with object
      - memory is available for long during or till prog terminates
      - acces any where
      - use when we have common data across the project

instance variables:
      - variable created inside the class
      - memory is alocatted every time when object is created.
      - is associated with object
      - memory is deleted when the object is deleted
      - access only using the object
      - use to store the model or entity information ex: one object internally contains multiple data
