instance function or method:
---------------------------
-> write inside the class

-> 'self' is the mandatory argument for every instance function
 self:
    - self refers to the current obj under execution
    - every method inside class has self as default argument and the 1st argument.
    - self being 1st argument is mandatory

->  instance function can be called only using the object.
-> from a  instance function we can access the instance variables of the object using 'self'


ex:
def display():
    print("in display)


class Data:

  def show(self):
     print("hello")


# Data is the class
# display()  is a global funtion [ outside the class ]
# show() is a instance function [ inside the class ]


How to call global function:
-----------------------------------
display()


syntax for calling the instance method:
--------------------------------------------
1.create the object
2.call the instance function using the object
 
instance function() --> common function for all the objects  created for the class



#create the object
d = Data()

#call the function using the object
d.show()
 
Object is the default arg available to the instance method in the form of self.
using instance methods you dont need to pass data every time


assignment:
class Product has
 - prodId,prodName,productBrand ,price , discount  as "instance variables"
 - showProduct() -> instance funtion to show product info
 - finalPrice()-> instance funtion to print final price after discount
 - takeInput() -> instance funtion to take input for  prodId,prodName,productBrand ,price , discount

 create two objects
 
 
 -perform for 5 objects
