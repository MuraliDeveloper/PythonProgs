instance function or method:
---------------------------
-> write inside the class
->  instance function can be called only using the object.
-> from a  instance function can access the instance variables of the object using 'self'
 self:
    - self refers to the current obj under execution
    - every method inside class has self as default argument and the 1st argument.
    - self being 1st argument is mandatory


Object is the default arg available to the instance method in the form of self.
using instance methods you dont need to pass data every time


assignment:
class Product has
 - prodId,prodName,productBrand ,price , discount  as "instance variables"
 - showProduct() -> instance funtion to show product info
 - finalPrice()-> instance funtion to print final price after discount
 - takeInput() -> instance funtion to take input for  prodId,prodName,productBrand ,price , discount

 create two objects
